- Create a PHP code to parse and print (to the commandline - standard output) product name, 

price and stock (is/is not on stock) of a product from a

   - Example page we will be testing the code against: 

http://www.pixmania.co.uk/consumer-dslr/canon-eos-700d-body-only/21326410-a.html

   - Code is required to be executable from command line (using php interpret version 5).

   - If you feel that instructions are not detail enough in some regard, proceed with your own best guess/practice.

   - Example product page was last validated on 2nd of September 2014. If the example page does not contain product (not sold anymore), let us know and pick another product in the meantime. 

   - Once you are fine with the code, send it back to us. You can post a partial solution if you find the task too hard to accomplish.

Example output - you are not required to produce it exactly like that, it is just an example:

```
#!bash


Product: CANON EOS 700D body only
Price: 355.99
In stock: Yes
```
